# Monster Hunter World - Hunter's Notes

An app that fetches data of monsters from the MHW API and presents it as three different categories.

## Lessons Learned

Implemented basic API fetch using VanillaJS, the challenge was presenting this data in a formal fashion. Improved my understanding of accessing JSON data and learned about the CORS policy of data access.

Learned about using trie data-structure for implementing auto-complete in the search bar. Learned to refactor JS code by encasing distinguishable logic in a separate function for more readability. Used many and learned a lot about event listeners and how to use 'bind' to pass parameters while avoiding it triggering.

## Possible Future Updates

* Major style makeover, current style is bland but works to show funcitonality.
* Change data presentation style as screen rotates.
* Possibly help update API source code, as some data is missing about some monsters (e.g. 'rewards' show up empty).
